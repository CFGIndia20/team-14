# Technologies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript backend/server-side solution of choice

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node framework that makes handling http requests with ease

- [PassportJS](http://passportjs.org/) - authentication middleware used to guard certain parts of the app for non-authenticated requests

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - data storage solution that just speaks JSON and pairs very well with Node

- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - package that helps with object modeling and manages connection between server and database

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS/JS framework, makes it easy to develop responsive, well polished web apps

# How it works

On the client-side users can create accounts that will be stored in the database. Then users can authenticate with the given credentials, if those are correct the server redirects the client to the home page. The client stores it for use on restricted backend route requests.

Once authenticated, there is a quiz to allocate students to batches in accordance with their skills. Teachers on logging in, will be able to see the slots assigned to them. The admin has universal access, and receives exception requests.

Once the 4 month program is over, on the basis of attendance, students are made eligible to be able to apply for jobs.

Slots are attached to teachers using the most effecient algorithms to maximise the resource usage.

# Motivation
